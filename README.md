# RayCasting

This project uses SFML and Fong's pomodels are produced by Ray Casting sphere.

## Introduction

RayCasting is a 3D graphics project that uses ray casting techniques to render 3D objects on the screen. It uses SFML library for graphics and input, and Fong's pomodels are produced by Ray Casting sphere. The project was created as part of a graphics programming course and serves as a demonstration of the ray casting technique.

## Features

- Rendering of 3D objects using ray casting technique
- Support for Fong's pomodels
- Customizable options such as light position

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vorontsov-amd/RayCasting.git`
2. Install SFML library by following the instructions provided in the SFML documentation.
3. Compile the source code: `make`
4. Run the executable: `./sfml-app`

## Example

This is an example of how the program works. You can change the ambient, diffuse and specular parameters to add more glare or general illumination
